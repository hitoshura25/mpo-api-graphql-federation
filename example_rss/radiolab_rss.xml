      <title>Swimming with Shadows: A Radiolab Week of Sharks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 1975, Jaws scared an entire generation out of the water. The film burned an idea into our cultural memory: they are mindless, man-eating monsters. We set out to tell a different story about sharks. Five stories over five days. We tear down deep-seated myths about sharks, plunge into the water with them, and find sharks that explode our sense of what they are – flying sharks, glowing sharks, baby sharks, sharks under attack, and sharks that may save millions of human lives.</p><p>Look out for brand-new episodes in your podcast feed starting June 16th through June 20th. </p><p>Visit our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaum_fMDGgFQCmKHUBPq_xg">YouTube channel</a> to check out the video trailer for the series and make sure to subscribe for more behind the scenes content throughout the week.  </p><p>For more details about the series, visit <a href="www.radiolab.org/sharks">radiolab.org/sharks </a></p><p>Follow us on Instagram @radiolab</p>
